**# sqnces**

sqnces is a word puzzle game where you are given a 3-letter sequence and must use it to guess a hidden word. Test your vocabulary, deduction skills, and pattern recognition as you try to identify the hidden word.

#### How to Play

1. \***\*Get a Sequence:\*\*** You start with a 3-letter sequence (e.g., `ENT`).
2. \***\*Form Guesses:\*\*** Use the sequence to form guess-words that may match the hidden word. Your guesses must follow these rules:
   - \***\*Include the Sequence:\*\*** Each guess-word must contain the 3-letter sequence in the exact order provided.
   - \***\*Word Length:\*\*** Guesses must be at least 4 letters long and cannot exceed the length of the hidden word.
3. \***\*Feedback on Guesses:\*\*** Each guess will provide clues:
   - \***\*Red Tile:\*\*** The letter does not exist in the hidden word.
   - \***\*Gray Tile:\*\*** The letter exists but is in the wrong position.
   - \***\*Green Tile:\*\*** The letter is in the correct position.
   - \***\*Out-of-Bounds Warning:\*\*** Letters that exceed the length of the hidden word are marked as out-of-bounds.
4. \***\*Guess Until Correct:\*\*** Use feedback from each guess to zero in on the hidden word.

#### Example Guesses (non hard mode)

For a 6-letter hidden word:

- **ðŸŸ¥** Letter does not exist in the hidden word.
- **ðŸŸ¨** Letter is in the hidden word but in the wrong position.
- **ðŸŸ©** Letter is in the correct position.
- **â¬œ** Letter exceeds the length of the hidden word.

#### Guess Breakdown

**ðŸŸ¥ V â¬› E â¬› N â¬› T**  
_V does not exist in the hidden word, however a letter does exist in that position._

**â¬› E â¬› N â¬› T â¬œ E ðŸŸ¨ R**  
_E and R are in positions where there are no letters - they exceed the length of the hidden word. Also, R exists elsewhere in the hidden word._

**ðŸŸ¥ S ðŸŸ¨ P â¬› E â¬› N â¬› T**  
_P exists in the hidden word but is in the wrong position._

**ðŸŸ© P ðŸŸ¥ O ðŸŸ¥ T â¬› E â¬› N â¬› T**  
_P is in the correct position._

**ðŸŸ© P ðŸŸ© A ðŸŸ© R ðŸŸ© E ðŸŸ© N ðŸŸ© T**  
_The correct word was **PARENT**!_
